### **Mini Project 2: Dockerize a Simple Web Application with Port Binding**

#### **Problem Statement:**
In this project, you'll Dockerize a basic Flask web application and expose it to your local machine via port binding. This will introduce you to the concept of networking in Docker, as you'll make the app accessible through a specific port on your machine.

#### **Timebox:**
1.5 - 2 Hours
